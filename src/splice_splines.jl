    splice_splines(left_spline::Schumaker, right_spline::Schumaker, splice_point::Real)
This puts two splines together. Making a new spline.
Note that the stitched together spline is not guaranteed to be continuous or shape preserving anymore.
### Inputs
* `left_spline` - The spline to use on the left.
* `right_spline` - The spline to use on the right.
* `splice_point` - The x coordinate to stitch at.
### Returns
* A Schumaker struct
