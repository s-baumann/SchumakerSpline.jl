This is a shape preserving spline which is guaranteed to be monotonic and concave/convex if the data is monotonic and concave/convex. It does not use any numerical optimisation and is therefore quick and smoothly converges to a fixed point in economic dynamics problems including value function iteration. Analytical derivatives and integrals of the spline can easily be taken through the evaluate and evaluate_integral functions.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"SchumakerSpline.jl","title":"SchumakerSpline.jl","text":"This package has the same basic functionality as the R package called schumaker.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"SchumakerSpline.jl","title":"SchumakerSpline.jl","text":"If you want to do algebraic operations on splines you can also use a schumaker spline through the UnivariateFunctions package.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Optional-parameters-1","page":"SchumakerSpline.jl","title":"Optional parameters","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Gradients.-1","page":"SchumakerSpline.jl","title":"Gradients.","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"SchumakerSpline.jl","title":"SchumakerSpline.jl","text":"The gradients at each of the (x,y) points can be input to give more accuracy.
